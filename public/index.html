Mars One wants to establish a permanent human colony on Mars by 2030

---

background-image: url(img/mars-settler-internet.jpg)

???

Mars One says that, for astronauts on Mars,

> Easy Internet access will be limited to their preferred sites that are constantly updated on the local Mars web server. Other websites will take between 6 and 45 minutes to appear on their screen - first 3-22 minutes for your click to reach Earth, and then another 3-22 minutes for the website data to reach Mars. Contact friends at home is possible by video, voice or text message–e-mail, WhatsApp, sms–but real time dialogue is not possible, because of the time delay.

Here's a simple page of text; the sort Mars One might imagine when it says "preferred sites to be updated on local Mars server"

---

background-image: url(img/patreon.png)

Except even this page expects interactivity! Is it acceptable to leave Martians out of this sort of discussion?

---

background-image: url(img/social-media-icons.png)

At a next level of interactivity, we have social media sites. These are certainly many-to-many! You are expected to contribute. Instagram would not be very "Insta" on Mars!

---

*meanwhile, in 2017*

# why should we care?

---

## tomorrow's problems
## ===
## today's problems but *bigger*

???

Thesis statement.

So if we start solving tomorrow's problems now, we will fix current problems and improve the current world. I'll phrase a lot of this talk around helping and serving people. If that's not motivating for you, you're welcome to translate "helping people" into "making money" in your head. Every now and then, it might actually be true that you can help people and make money off of them at the same time.

*Earth problem 1*

# Latency

---

background-image: url(img/amazon-data-centers.png)

Depending on where you've deployed your app and where your customers are, they could experience some significant latencies. Six minutes?

This image shows how the internet grew worldwide from 2000 - 2012. Found on [Vox - 40 Maps That Explain The Internet](https://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps)

Lots of countries are starting to come online, but the infrastructure still isn't reliable. An internet that works even on Mars would make using the internet much more feasible for these people.

---

# [86 million](http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/nigeria/)

The number of internet users in Nigeria, with just 46% of population online. That's a large number of people to be helped.

---

background-image: url(img/airplane-mode.png)

Then there are all the more prosaic times that we have poor network connectivity.

The network has many edges where disconnection and flaky connections are a regular occurrence.

*Earth Problem 2*

# Censorship

Bandwidth usage is soaring, driven by the proliferation of Internet-connected devices.

---

background-image: url(img/nielsen-law-internet-speed-trend-curve.png)

???

From [Nielson](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/):

> Nielsen's law is similar to the more established Moore's law. Unfortunately, comparing the two laws shows that bandwidth grows slower than computer power. Moore's law says that computers double in capabilities every 18 months, which corresponds to about 60% annual growth.

---

background-image: url(img/neilsons-law-vs-moores-law.png)

???

Again from [Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/):

> As shown in the table, bandwidth will remain the gating factor in the experienced quality of using the internet medium.

## growth in data demand outpaces network speed

Making the internet work on Mars means Martians would be able to get content directly from each other, rather than needing to wait for a round-trip to Earth.

An internet built in this way would also get around bottlenecks in delivering super-fast 4K video, VR experiences, and the increasingly huge IoT data sets created here on Earth.

---

# what do we do

???

So what do we do about it?

It would be super great if we could build one intermediate layer between users and websites which solved this whole problem without existing websites needing to change. Is that possible?

No. That is not possible. The basic architecture of web pages and apps need to change.

What will this new app architecture look like?

Well, there are two parts to this solution. One is here, right now, and you can start using it. These are the technologies that fit under the banner of Offline First.

The second approach--and the bigger change--is the Distributed Web. This is currently emerging, and if you get involved, you can inform the sort of future we fall into.

From [Bradley Holt](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/offline-first-whats-in-a-name-89c410910694):

> With an Offline First approach you design your app for the most resource-constrained environments first, and then apply progressive enhancement techniques to make your app work better and better as it has access to more and more resources.
>
> Using an Offline First approach means that your app will not only work offline, but your app will work better when it has access to only a flaky network connection, and your app will even work better when it has a great network connection. Without this intent to design your app for the progression from offline to limited connectivity to great connectivity, there would be no reason to call it Offline First.

Advice from [@inkel](http://twitter.com/inkel): Don't engage with people that ask a "question" that is in fact a comment or a _I might know better about the subject you're talking about and this is why_. Instead tell them it's a great question and that you can discuss the subject on the hallway track. After all, it's your presentation, not theirs 😉
