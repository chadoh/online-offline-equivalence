Mars One wants to establish a permanent human colony on Mars by 2030

---

background-image: url(img/mars-settler-internet.jpg)

???

Mars One says that, for astronauts on Mars,

> Easy Internet access will be limited to their preferred sites that are constantly updated on the local Mars web server. Other websites will take between 6 and 45 minutes to appear on their screen - first 3-22 minutes for your click to reach Earth, and then another 3-22 minutes for the website data to reach Mars. Contact friends at home is possible by video, voice or text message–e-mail, WhatsApp, sms–but real time dialogue is not possible, because of the time delay.

"preferred sites that are constantly updated on the local Mars web server"

# does this even qualify as the Internet?

the internet is

# *controlled by its participants*

the internet is

# *a great democratizer*

# and if I *can't contribute*

# then it *doesn't count*

---

Let's think through it

---

background-image: url(img/patreon-no-share.png)

???

Here's a simple page of text; the sort Mars One might imagine when it says "preferred sites to be updated on local Mars server"

---

background-image: url(img/patreon.png)

???

Except even this page expects interactivity! Is it acceptable to leave Martians out of this sort of discussion?

---

background-image: url(img/social-media-icons.png)

???

At a next level of interactivity, we have social media sites. These are certainly many-to-many! You are expected to contribute. Instagram would not be very "Insta" on Mars!

---

background-image: url(img/slack.jpg)

Finally, all the apps that require real-time collaboration would just be totally broken on Mars

---

*meanwhile, in 2017*

# why should we care?

---

If we solve tomorrow's problems today, we will

* help people
* make the world better

???

Sometimes, those two things even go together! I'm going to frame a lot of this talk around helping people and making the world better, because it's the part I care about more. But if it's more motivating for you, you can translate "helping people" and "making the world better" into "making money" in your head.

Depending on where you've deployed your app and where your customers are, they could experience some significant latencies. Six minutes?

Lots of countries are starting to come online, but the infrastructure still isn't reliable. An internet that works even on Mars would make using the internet much more feasible for these people.

Then of course, there's internet censorship, which is a similar problem. Would internet that works even on Mars fix this, too?

---

background-image: url(img/airplane-mode.png)

???

Then there are all the more prosaic times that we have poor network connectivity.

---

background-image: url(img/underground-mode.png)

???

the network has many edges where disconnection and flaky connections are a regular occurrence

---

## growth of data demand outpaces increase of network speed

???

TODO: Find a graph to show this!

Making the internet work on Mars means Martians would be able to get content directly from each other, rather than needing to wait for a round-trip to Earth.

An internet built in this way would also get around bottlenecks in delivering super-fast 4K video and other such large data demands here on Earth.

---

offline is not an edge case

(even in a connected world)

---

???

**SLIDE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK**

So what do we do about it?

It would be super great if we could build one intermediate layer between users and websites which solved this whole problem without existing websites needing to change. Is that possible?

No. That is not possible. The basic architecture of web pages and apps need to change.

What will this new app architecture look like?

Well, there are two parts to this solution. One is here, right now, and you can start using it. These are the technologies that fit under the banner of Offline First.

The second approach--and the bigger change--is the Distributed Web. This is currently emerging, and if you get involved, you can inform the sort of future we fall into.

# OFFLINE
# FIRST

???

From [Bradley Holt](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/offline-first-whats-in-a-name-89c410910694):

> With an Offline First approach you design your app for the most resource-constrained environments first, and then apply progressive enhancement techniques to make your app work better and better as it has access to more and more resources.
>
> Using an Offline First approach means that your app will not only work offline, but your app will work better when it has access to only a flaky network connection, and your app will even work better when it has a great network connection. Without this intent to design your app for the progression from offline to limited connectivity to great connectivity, there would be no reason to call it Offline First.

---

background-image: url(img/a-list-apart-offline-first.jpg)

???

What it doesn't mean: building your apps assuming that there will be constant fast connectivity, then adding in some graceful handling of inevitable network issues. That's the *graceful degradation* approach. It's analogous to designing for desktop, then trying to add support for mobile after you get complaints.

What Offline First champions is more like Mobile First. Don't treat lack of connectivity as an error state. This is the *progressive enhancement* approach. Assume that your users will be mostly, or at least frequently, offline. Then progressively enhance your app to take advantage of network connectivity when it's available.

---

background-image: url(img/instagram-error.png)

???

Old Instagram provides a good example of graceful degradation, and a good counter-example to offline first design.

Instagram has started making strides toward being fully offline first, and already is for Android. [Source](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/offline-first-whats-in-a-name-89c410910694).

[Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) is a backend for JS apps that makes offline first simple. From Hoodie's FAQ:

> Hoodie core only provides typical backend APIs, for user authentication and data persistence. It does not interact with the DOM at all. It perfectly works with any MV* framework or template engines.

BitTorrent created in 2001 and is still alive despite concerted, international, billion dollar efforts to destroy it; the BitTorrent community remains impossible to stop because it is both globally decentralized and continues to deliver value.

Questions?

???

Advice from [@inkel](http://twitter.com/inkel): Don't engage with people that ask a "question" that is in fact a comment or a _I might know better about the subject you're talking about and this is why_. Instead tell them it's a great question and that you can discuss the subject on the hallway track. After all, it's your presentation, not theirs 😉
