Mars One says that, for astronauts on Mars, 'Easy Internet access will be limited to their preferred sites that are constantly updated on the local Mars web server. Other websites will take between 6 and 45 minutes to appear on their screen - first 3-22 minutes for your click to reach Earth, and then another 3-22 minutes for the website data to reach Mars. Contact friends at home is possible by video, voice or text message–e-mail, WhatsApp, sms–but real time dialogue is not possible, because of the time delay.'

<!--
what it doesn't mean: building your apps assuming that there will be constant fast connectivity, then adding in some graceful handling of inevitable network issues. That's the *graceful degradation* approach. It's analogous to designing for desktop, then trying to add support for mobile after you get complaints.

What Offline First champions is more like Mobile First. Don't treat lack of connectivity as an error state. This is the *progressive enhancement* approach. Assume that your users will be mostly, or at least frequently, offline. Then progressively enhance your app to take advantage of network connectivity when it's available.
